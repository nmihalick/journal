a journal entry detailing how to use kanso to rapidly build a new app.

= the app =
a shopping list app. this app should have the following features:
* multiple stores
* multiple lists going at the same time
* collect quantity + item name
* provide checkbox to tick off items gotten while shopping

= pre-setup =
* install couchdb
* install node.js
* install kanso
* start couchdb

= getting started =
* git init && README
* initial directory setup
* download the html for the shopping list mockup.
* download full, responsive, bootstrap.
* download purl.js jquery extension

= html, js, css, and bootstrap =
before connecting to anything on the back-end, you can do a lot with html and
css. i like using bootstrap, so i'm going to include that in this phase.
* create main.css placeholder
* create main.js placeholder
* create index.html
* mock the shopping list in html using only bootstrap provided classes
** list selector
** shopping list
** title
** shop / edit nav
** add items to list - textarea for multi-adds

= adding basic interaction =
start filling in main.js to add some interaction
* setup view and controller namespaces
* toggle the shop and edit nav and what it shows
* add example json for the list
* add view for the items converted to programmatic
* add items using the textarea
* add remove item controls

= what about kanso? =
* create .kansorc
* create app.js
* build kanso.json
* kanso install and push
* build test lists and upload them

== connecting to couch db ==
* the db module + the jquery module
* display the test data
* save the changes
* build a view for all the lists
* show the lists in the sidebar
* start a new list
